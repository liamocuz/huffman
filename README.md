# Huffman Coding  

This is a repo for a lab assignment that I had in ECE368 at Purdue my Sophomore year with Professor Koh. I remember not doing so hot on it my first time, so as I was cleaning out my notebooks after graduation, the assignment fell out and so I thought I should try it again with more knowledge and experience in C.
